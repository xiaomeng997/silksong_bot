# HANDOFF - M2 integration (branch m2-integration-6)

One section per merged chain; each keeps its chain's own text (headings demoted one level) including its Next steps.
Paths to worktrees / run dirs in a section are that chain's, not this integration worktree's.

## Chain R - Forum route research (branch worktree-wf_c0d56d51-4cb-5)

Original title: HANDOFF - Task R (Forum route research, offline)

Worktree `C:\modeling\silksong_bot\.claude\worktrees\wf_c0d56d51-4cb-5`, branch `worktree-wf_c0d56d51-4cb-5`.
Finished normally (no stop). Offline only: no game instance used, no job running.

### Done (committed)

- `docs/research/forum_route.md` (Chinese): Ascendant's Grip (Jubilana's shop in Songclave, 350 rosaries, after the
  "Save City Merchant" wish + Song_07 ambush), Reaper chapel (Greymoor_07 -> 20b -> 20c, 4-wave gauntlet, shrine
  needs 3 Binds, AutoEquipCrestV2 strips non-skill tools until a bench, respawn set to the chapel + autosave, ~8-9 s
  pause disabled), G&Z chain (Greymoor_05 forced first meeting, roof shortcut lever in Library_09, garmondInLibrary
  only via TimePasses, spar 460 HP, garmondWillAidInForumBattle via the FSM variable override, Hang_06 recruit),
  LoadedFromMenu call chain (Continue / new game only) and re-recruit, Cogfly (Hang_09, 1 Tool Metal, 0 rosaries,
  8.3-9.3 s no pause), Reaper slots and conflicts (Grip vs Weighted Belt, lockets per crest), time estimates (gate
  distances + pace from the human recording), DESIGN 3.6.4 / 3.6.5 (+3.5.7 / 3.7.5) edit proposals, open items.
- Fixer pass (same day) after the verifier round:
  - Songclave prerequisite (new section 1.1): the wish board, Jubilana and the Songclave RestBench are children of
    "Enclave States/States/Level 1", active only at enclaveLevel >= 1. 0 -> 1 happens only in TimePasses outside
    Song_Enclave and Bellshrine_Enclave with metCaretaker; metCaretaker comes from the forced Caretaker cutscene,
    which exists only after the Songclave bell (bellShrineEnclave). The bell-tower Bell Bench appears after ringing
    and is an equally close TimePasses option for garmondInLibrary at S21. Grip times, S18/S20/S21 proposals and a
    route_check assertion updated.
  - G&Z lethality: WildSlash Hero Damager 5's second DamageHero (flags 0) analysed in code (HeroBox uses the first
    component; the clash path is per component but deduped via PreventDamage/HasBeenDamaged) - probably harmless,
    not proven, treated as lethal; rule "at 1 mask every G&Z hit counts as lethal".
  - Hang_06 visual rule restricted to "on entering the scene"; recruit state read from the dialogue key
    (GARMOND_AID_READY = recruited; MEET_FORUM / REPEAT + REQUEST_AID = not recruited).
  - LoadSceneSingleCustom removed from the LoadedFromMenu paths (it never calls BeginSceneTransition).
  - "Talk to Garmond twice at S11" dropped (net zero; Moorwing branch can pre-empt TALK1).
  - Group A time given per case: 4-7 / 7-12 / 4-9.5 / 7-14.5 min.
  - Reaper slot table now cites crestitems.bundle directly (fx_crest_slots.py), not the untracked crests.json.

### Scripts / raw outputs

`C:\ssbot\sandbox\forum_route_scripts\` (UnityPy scripts run with the scratch venv
`C:\Users\Meng\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--modeling-silksong-bot\99d0a17d-64d3-4738-80f4-0ed168134124\scratchpad\venv\Scripts\python.exe`;
`pace.py` runs with `..\scripts\uv.cmd run python` from brain). Fixer-pass files start with `fx_`.

### Next (for the lead / a live agent)

1. Live checks listed in forum_route.md section 8 (Continue clears garmondAidForumBattle and Garmond reappears in
   Hang_06; Reaper shrine sequence; Stun Box and WildSlash 5 lethality via LethalBlock would_die; Hang_09 mite reach;
   caravan bench in S11; Songclave bell -> Caretaker -> enclaveLevel 1 sequence).
2. Merge the DESIGN proposals (section 7) after K1 decides Reaper / Grip; check whether the S18 route rings the
   Songclave bell.
3. `docs/facts/1.0.30000/crests.json` (P17 output) is still untracked in the main checkout; the research doc no longer
   depends on it (it cites the asset bundle), but the lead may want to commit it.

## Chain W - Forum kinematics, Reaper attack shapes, coverage map (branch worktree-wf_946a7803-63c-3)

Original title: HANDOFF — Task W (Forum movement kinematics, Reaper attack shapes, safe-pocket tool)

Round 3 (fixer) finished normally 2026-10-03 ~09:30 local. Worktree
`C:\modeling\silksong_bot\.claude\worktrees\wf_946a7803-63c-3`, branch `worktree-wf_946a7803-63c-3`. Everything is
committed; no job of mine is running (instance 3 idle, input released). Detached worktrees I made and can be removed
with `git worktree remove`: `C:\ssbot\live_kn_d4ffef8` (recorded the held-out runs; numba warm) and
`C:\ssbot\kn_hunter_ref` (main f329afb, for the Hunter bit-identity check). `C:\ssbot\live_kn_7a56ead` is round 2's.

Facts: `docs/facts/1.0.30000/movement_kinematics.md` (1.7 terrain thunk, 1.8 slopes / ceiling contact, 1.9 wall
landing, 1.2 / 1.3 / 1.4 / 1.4b updates, 3 polygon frames, 4 coverage map, 5 fit / dev / held-out acceptance, Reaper
audit correction, lane choice, 6 bench).

### Done this round (review findings of round 2)

- Held-out acceptance redone: model frozen at f6c75de; fresh runs recorded first (from d4ffef8, never read before the
  freeze) and evaluated once: `C:\ssbot\data\runs\m2\kn_excite_forum\2026-10-03\TRAIN\kn_excite_forum_s98600` (wall,
  220 trials) and `..._s98700` (floor, 180 trials). B / D are now called the dev set.
- Acceptance definition fixed (decision-time information only): `kin_check --lanes bounds_lo_mix --bounds-events none`
  (no logged contact events: the empty room has nothing for a threat layer to announce), slope windows and mantle
  windows ("locked", Forum parameters) counted. Covered: fit 99.06 %, dev 99.08 %, held-out 99.26 % (wall run 99.45 %,
  floor run 98.90 %); held-out dash 97.3 %, glide 98.1 %, contact 89.8 % below 99 % (facts 5.3 has the diagnosis).
- Model (Forum only; Hunter rollout bit-identical to main on 40 000 frames of 171806 i0_000, all settings): side / up
  slash terrain thunk (AB_THUNK, rows ATK_KIND / ALT / ALT_T / ATK_PDIR, slash polygons in the parameter tail), sloped
  edge collision + roof CancelJump + ceiling late contact (AB_SLOPES, slope_contact 0.005), scramble roof ray at
  Scramble Up's OnEnter and REPEAT DASH from Scramble Up, scr_roof_t 0.0835 (fit bug: entry frame counted twice),
  rpr_thunk_* refit on the fit runs only, glide Bump phase, wall-contact landing (CheckTouchingGround 0.16), estimator
  wallUnstickSteps / wall-jump chain / skid mode / thunk test with two steps, Sprint Grace from Start Sprint (wrong,
  see Next 1).
- Lanes: new `bounds_lo` (bounds + one lane at the limiter's frame time) recommended for the planner (Hunter 97.92 %
  at hull p95 0.020 u vs bounds_ft 98.06 % at 0.348); `bounds_lo_mix` (+2 mixed-phase lanes) used for the Forum
  acceptance figure, same held-out number as bounds_lo, 1.9 x the cost of bounds.
- attack_hit_audit: a hit on the hero ends the swing; Reaper normal 100 / 0 / 3 (the 22 "boss does not take hits"
  FPs were swings cancelled by the hero being hit before frame 5). attack_table_build: live polygons in the rendered
  transform's frame (all samples rigid, 0.000 u); reaper.json up slot back to the dump polygon.
- coverage_map: conservative raster (outline supercover, edge / 2-point colliders, capsule arcs pushed out, the
  oracle's circle octagon instead of a circle around its first vertex), consecutive-frame sweep, hidden entities.
  Bell Beast pockets: left door 1.44 u, right door 1.59 u (were 1.91 / 0.34, both from the circle fix).
- Provenance: `kin_fit_forum.HAND_SET` writes a source entry for every hand-set Forum value.

### Needs the lead

- Oracle deploy (unchanged from round 2): `slash.dump` `paths` (commit 572f0e7, built `-p:Deploy=false`), then on
  instance 3 from this branch: `..\scripts\uv.cmd run python -m ssbot.probes.kin_excite_forum --instance 3 --savestate
  kn_forum_floor --x-safe 33 63 --random-dir --seed 98420 --trials 0 --attack-frames 40 --attack-kinds
  "reaper_attack,dash_attack"`, then `attack_table_build --crest Reaper --live <A>/attack_frames.jsonl
  <s98400>/attack_frames.jsonl <s98410>/attack_frames.jsonl <new>/attack_frames.jsonl` and re-run
  `attack_hit_audit C:\ssbot\data\runs\m2\20261002_225836_BellBeastReaper_data --crest Reaper --instances 3 --slack 0`.
- Planner integration (later round, planner.py not touched): use the lane set `bounds_lo`; the Forum model's nominal
  rollout costs ~2.5 x Hunter's (facts 6).

### Next (in order)

1. Sprint Grace timer: read hornet_sprint's Sprint Timer action (UnityPy venv:
   `C:\Users\Meng\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--modeling-silksong-bot\99d0a17d-64d3-4738-80f4-0ed168134124\scratchpad\upy\.venv`,
   dumps `upy\fsm_*.txt`); the 7 logged ground releases fit a ground-only timer with a threshold in 0.183–0.283 s.
2. Ground dash into an adjacent wall: the Ground Sprint OnEnter Translate pushes the model's box into the wall and the
   sprint runs through it (held-out T1, 6 dashes, 3 u); the sprint FSM ends against the wall in the game.
3. Mantle (Mantle FSM dump in `upy\fsm_Mantle.txt`: Check Forward rays, Cling, Vault +1.6, Land) — not in the Forum
   arena, but in the test rooms; at least predict the AIR MANTLE trigger so the planner avoids it.
4. Glide inflate 11 vs 12 frames (held-out T2) and the one recoil off an object missing from the TERRAIN dump.
5. Reaper dash attack movement (Sprint FSM Reaper Antic / Upper / End) is not modelled; Clawline not started.
6. More fresh held-out data for a second freeze (new seeds from 98800; 98600 / 98700 are spent).
