# HANDOFF - Task R (Forum route research, offline)

Worktree `C:\modeling\silksong_bot\.claude\worktrees\wf_c0d56d51-4cb-5`, branch `worktree-wf_c0d56d51-4cb-5`.
Finished normally (no stop). Offline only: no game instance used, no job running.

## Done (committed)

- `docs/research/forum_route.md` (Chinese): Ascendant's Grip (Jubilana's shop in Songclave, 350 rosaries, after the
  "Save City Merchant" wish + Song_07 ambush), Reaper chapel (Greymoor_07 -> 20b -> 20c, 4-wave gauntlet, shrine
  needs 3 Binds, AutoEquipCrestV2 strips non-skill tools until a bench, respawn set to the chapel + autosave, ~8-9 s
  pause disabled), G&Z chain (Greymoor_05 forced first meeting, roof shortcut lever in Library_09, garmondInLibrary
  only via TimePasses, spar 460 HP, garmondWillAidInForumBattle via the FSM variable override, Hang_06 recruit),
  LoadedFromMenu call chain (Continue / new game only) and re-recruit, Cogfly (Hang_09, 1 Tool Metal, 0 rosaries,
  8.3-9.3 s no pause), Reaper slots and conflicts (Grip vs Weighted Belt, lockets per crest), time estimates (gate
  distances + pace from the human recording), DESIGN 3.6.4 / 3.6.5 (+3.5.7 / 3.7.5) edit proposals, open items.
- Fixer pass (same day) after the verifier round:
  - Songclave prerequisite (new section 1.1): the wish board, Jubilana and the Songclave RestBench are children of
    "Enclave States/States/Level 1", active only at enclaveLevel >= 1. 0 -> 1 happens only in TimePasses outside
    Song_Enclave and Bellshrine_Enclave with metCaretaker; metCaretaker comes from the forced Caretaker cutscene,
    which exists only after the Songclave bell (bellShrineEnclave). The bell-tower Bell Bench appears after ringing
    and is an equally close TimePasses option for garmondInLibrary at S21. Grip times, S18/S20/S21 proposals and a
    route_check assertion updated.
  - G&Z lethality: WildSlash Hero Damager 5's second DamageHero (flags 0) analysed in code (HeroBox uses the first
    component; the clash path is per component but deduped via PreventDamage/HasBeenDamaged) - probably harmless,
    not proven, treated as lethal; rule "at 1 mask every G&Z hit counts as lethal".
  - Hang_06 visual rule restricted to "on entering the scene"; recruit state read from the dialogue key
    (GARMOND_AID_READY = recruited; MEET_FORUM / REPEAT + REQUEST_AID = not recruited).
  - LoadSceneSingleCustom removed from the LoadedFromMenu paths (it never calls BeginSceneTransition).
  - "Talk to Garmond twice at S11" dropped (net zero; Moorwing branch can pre-empt TALK1).
  - Group A time given per case: 4-7 / 7-12 / 4-9.5 / 7-14.5 min.
  - Reaper slot table now cites crestitems.bundle directly (fx_crest_slots.py), not the untracked crests.json.

## Scripts / raw outputs

`C:\ssbot\sandbox\forum_route_scripts\` (UnityPy scripts run with the scratch venv
`C:\Users\Meng\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--modeling-silksong-bot\99d0a17d-64d3-4738-80f4-0ed168134124\scratchpad\venv\Scripts\python.exe`;
`pace.py` runs with `..\scripts\uv.cmd run python` from brain). Fixer-pass files start with `fx_`.

## Next (for the lead / a live agent)

1. Live checks listed in forum_route.md section 8 (Continue clears garmondAidForumBattle and Garmond reappears in
   Hang_06; Reaper shrine sequence; Stun Box and WildSlash 5 lethality via LethalBlock would_die; Hang_09 mite reach;
   caravan bench in S11; Songclave bell -> Caretaker -> enclaveLevel 1 sequence).
2. Merge the DESIGN proposals (section 7) after K1 decides Reaper / Grip; check whether the S18 route rings the
   Songclave bell.
3. `docs/facts/1.0.30000/crests.json` (P17 output) is still untracked in the main checkout; the research doc no longer
   depends on it (it cites the asset bundle), but the lead may want to commit it.
